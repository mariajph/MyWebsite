    <h1>Frequently Asked QUestions</h1>

    <h2>How does Raptor work?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Gillette On Demand is designed to make shaving easier than ever before – and on your terms.
            First, pick the Raptor razor and blade refills that are best for you. Then, select whether 
            you would like to make a one-time purchase or subscribe for monthly deliveries. 
            A subscription shave plan is the easiest way to have fresh blades delivered to your door. 
            There is no red tape, no annual commitments, and no hidden extras. You can change your plan or cancel at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How can I modify or cancel my subscription?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>The subscription program is easy to join, manage and cancel at any time. Log in and select
             “my account” to modify your subscription.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How long will my order take to arrive?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Your package usually arrives within 2-7 business days of when you place your order. You can 
            track all shipments on your account page. If you placed
             a subscription order, select “subscription” to check your order status or make changes. If 
             you placed a one-time order, your order will appear at the bottom of your account page.

            Once your order ships, you will receive a shipping confirmation email that will include any 
            tracking information. Any recurring shipments are determined by the frequency you selected 
            when creating your shave plan.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why did the price of my subscription change?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>All prices and availability of products, including those for existing subscriptions, are 
            subject to change without notice, up until the order is completed and confirmed. We make 
            every effort to provide you the most accurate information on pricing and availability. 
            All subscribers will receive a reminder confirmation email 10 days prior to your 
            subscription’s next ship date with the details of your next order, including the total 
            estimated cost for each subscription order. Please refer to our Store Policy for more details.</p>
